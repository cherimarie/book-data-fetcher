The Complete Jesus *Ricky Alan Mayotte*Ricky Alan Mayotte has taken the words of Jesus from the gospels in which they originally appeared and organized them into nine chapters by category, among them Parable, Commandments, Hymns and Prayers, and Warnings and Admonitions. His approach allows the reader a unique opportunity to see and compare the wide range of Jesus's sayings and teachings and lends to the book a readability that makes it an adventure to explore. Each chapter begins with the most familiar sayings and teachings from the canonical gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and then progresses to the more elusive, often enigmatic attributions found in the Apocryphal and Gnostic texts. In some of these writings, Jesus appears as a far more unusual figure than he is generally imagined.*1883642450*1997

Join the conversation, and believe in the power of a Christian response to suffering.*0970302886*2000-11
Bold as Love A Near Future Fantasy*Gwyneth Jones*Imagine John L:ennon met Mick Jagger around 1968, really hit it off, went through the collapse of modern civilisation together, and changed from rockstars into genuine heroes. And came out on the other side ruling England. And imagine they were both in love with the same girl, and this gorgeous babe they both adored turned out to be . . . But this story isn't actually set in 1968, it's an alternate Now, and Fiorinda is no hapless sixties rock chick, but a formidable power in her own right: a child of our times and a timeless heroine. Bold As Love is an evocative Arthurian fantasy in which cultural icons (rock and roll stars) are cast as man of destiny, peerless warrior companion at his side, with a band of faithful companions, a princess in jeopardy, battle scenes, fancy dress, Celtic mythology, true romance, a wicked magician, the Holy Grail . . . More magical than the classic Divine Endurance, more exciting and moving than the award-winning White Queen: Bold As Love is a shamelessly romantic fantasy about England that asks what would happen to the rock nobility if all those protest songs and idealist opinions were put to the test . . .*0575070315*2001

A Quaker Book of Wisdom Life Lessons In Simplicity, Service, And Common Sense*Robert Lawrence Smith*"The most valuable aspect of religion," writes Robert Lawrence Smith, "is that it provides us with a framework for living. I have always felt that the beauty and power of Quakerism is that it exhorts us to live more simply, more truthfully, more charitably." Taking his inspiration from the teaching of the first Quaker, George Fox, and from his own nine generations of Quaker forebears, Smith speaks to all of us who are seeking a way to make our lives simpler, more meaningful, and more useful. Beginning with the Quaker belief that "There is that of God in every person," Smith explores the ways in which we can harness the inner light of God that dwells in each of us to guide the personal choices and challenges we face every day. How to live and speak truthfully. How to listen for, trust, and act on our conscience. How to make our work an expression of the best that is in us. Using vivid examples from his own life, Smith writes eloquently of Quaker Meeting, his decision to fight in World War II, and later to oppose the Vietnam War. From his work as an educator and headmaster to his role as a husband and father, Smith quietly convinces that the lofty ideals of Quakerism offer all of us practical tools for leading a more meaningful life. His book culminates with a moving letter to his grandchildren which imparts ten lessons for "letting your life speak."*9780688172336*1999-08-18

Goatwalking A Guide to Wildland Living, a Quest for the Peaceable Kingdom*Jim Corbett*What is Goatwalking about? Come and see: join Jim Corbett (1933-2001) in an epic true set of often dangerous journeys, and searching spiritual adventures. Raised on western ranches and Indian reservations, Jim finished college in three years and took a Harvard masters in philosophy back to a career as a cowboy, librarian, desert guide and seeker. This path took sharp turns when the Central American wars of the 1980s brought turmoil to the border region. His pages move seamlessly from reopening a dried-up mountain spring, caring for goat udders, to being inspired by Don Quixote and Francis of Assisi, to dodging armed guerrillas and death squads in war-torn 1980s Central America. Jim co-created an epic sanctuary movement that brought thousands of desperate war refugees to safety - yet he did so not to disobey the law, but to uphold U. S. laws the government was itself defying daily. As part of this work, Jim also delved into and remixed Catholic, Protestant and Jewish theologies with Quaker peculiarities and traditions. He joined other religious activists to build an interfaith coalition with international reach and few parallels since the original Underground Railroad. It challenged presidents, coyotes, the Border Patrol, and both the Bible and the biblical God. Along the way, Jim also clearly foresaw coming climate and other social calamities, and sought to plant the seeds for a "peaceable kingdom" alternative in wilderness places like the Sonora Desert. Few activists of our time have combined so much advocacy with Jim's deeply reflective, desert mystic's temperament and wisdom. Goatwalking travels through years of war and tumult to a conclusion that, even in struggle, "The highest praise is silence." Ultimately, what is Goatwalking like? Like nothing else. Like Jim Corbett, his restless, brilliant mind, ever-seeking spirit, his love for the beautiful, turbulent wildlands he roamed, and the wider, threatened world he thought and wrote about so deeply there. First published in 1991, Goatwalking is finally back in print, and it's as timelessly mind-expanding, pioneering and prophetic as ever. Timeless. And just in time.*9798548568311*1991-07-30

Resurrection Myth or Reality?*John Shelby Spong*Using approaches from the Hebrew interpretive tradition to discern the actual events surrounging Jesus' death, Bishop Spong questions the hitorical validity of literal narrative concerned the Ressurection. He asserts that the resurrection story was born in an experience that opened the disciples' eyes to the reality of God and the meaning of Jesus of Nazareth. Spong traces the Christian origins of anti-Semitism to the Church's fabrication of the ultimate Jewish scapegoat, Judas Iscariot. He affirms the inclusiveness of the Christian message and emphasizes the necessity of mutual integrity and respect among Christians and Jews.*0060674296*1995-02-18

Compassion A Reflection on the Christian Life*Henri J. M. Nouwen,Donald P. Mcneill,Douglas A. Morrison*In this provocative essay on that least understood virtue, compassion, the authors challenge themselves and us with these questions: Where do we place compassion in our lives? Is it enough to live a life in which we hurt one another as little as possible? Is our guiding ideal a life of maximum pleasure and minimum pain? Compassion answers no. After years of study and discussion among themselves, with other religious, and with men and women at the very center of national politics, the authors look at compassion with a vigorous new perspective. They place compassion at the heart of a Christian life in a world governed far too long by principles of power and destructive control. Compassion, no longer merely an eraser of human mistakes, is a force of prayer and action -- the expression of God's love for us and our love for God and one another. Compassion is a book that says no to a compassion of guilt and failure and yes to a compassionate love that pervades our spirit and moves us to action. Henri Nouwen, Donald McNeill, and Douglas Morrison have written a moving document on what it means to be a Christian in a difficult time.*0385517521*2006-01-17

Dimensions of Prayer Cultivating a Relationship with God*Douglas V. Steere*Prayer can be wonderfully accessible to everyone. "In learning to pray, no laboratory is needed but a room, no apparatus but ourselves," Douglas Steere writes.

Prayer comes as a response to a God who "besieges us with love," he says. In Dimensions of Prayer, Steere answers common questions and concerns about prayer. Among the topics covered are petition, confession, adoration, intercessory prayer, and how to cope with dry times in prayer. This easy-to-read book offers new "pray-ers" an engaging introduction to prayer while providing valuable wisdom for mature Christians.*0835809714*2002
