The Complete Jesus *Ricky Alan Mayotte*Ricky Alan Mayotte has taken the words of Jesus from the gospels in which they originally appeared and organized them into nine chapters by category, among them Parable, Commandments, Hymns and Prayers, and Warnings and Admonitions. His approach allows the reader a unique opportunity to see and compare the wide range of Jesus's sayings and teachings and lends to the book a readability that makes it an adventure to explore. Each chapter begins with the most familiar sayings and teachings from the canonical gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and then progresses to the more elusive, often enigmatic attributions found in the Apocryphal and Gnostic texts. In some of these writings, Jesus appears as a far more unusual figure than he is generally imagined.*1883642450*1997
Nonviolent Communication A Language of Compassion*Marshall B. Rosenberg*Explains how to break patterns of thinking that lead to anger, depression and violence, transform potential conflicts into compassionate dialogues, speak your mind without creating resistance or hostility, hear whatever is said to you as a "please" or "thank you", create greater depth and caring in your intimate relationships, and motivate with compassion rather than with fear, guilt or shame.*1892005026*1999
Quaker Spirituality Selected Writings*Douglas Van Steere*Simplicity in forms of worship, opposition to violence, concern for social injustice, and, above all, a faith in the personal and corporate guidance of the Holy Spirit are characteristics of the spirituality of the people called Quakers. The author has assembled a comprehensive collection of Quaker writings.*0809125102*1984

You Are the Self *Daniel Clark*Our quest for drama has gone too far. We are alienated from our true identity, at war within our Self and with apparent others. Love is the recognition of the Self in the other. You are that Self. Come home.*9781497411074*2014-03-31
Bold as Love A Near Future Fantasy*Gwyneth Jones*Imagine John L:ennon met Mick Jagger around 1968, really hit it off, went through the collapse of modern civilisation together, and changed from rockstars into genuine heroes. And came out on the other side ruling England. And imagine they were both in love with the same girl, and this gorgeous babe they both adored turned out to be . . . But this story isn't actually set in 1968, it's an alternate Now, and Fiorinda is no hapless sixties rock chick, but a formidable power in her own right: a child of our times and a timeless heroine. Bold As Love is an evocative Arthurian fantasy in which cultural icons (rock and roll stars) are cast as man of destiny, peerless warrior companion at his side, with a band of faithful companions, a princess in jeopardy, battle scenes, fancy dress, Celtic mythology, true romance, a wicked magician, the Holy Grail . . . More magical than the classic Divine Endurance, more exciting and moving than the award-winning White Queen: Bold As Love is a shamelessly romantic fantasy about England that asks what would happen to the rock nobility if all those protest songs and idealist opinions were put to the test . . .*0575070315*2001
